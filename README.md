1. # GPA vs Salary Prediction Model 
This project demonstrates a machine learning model that predicts salaries based on GPA. The data is preprocessed, and a linear regression model is trained to fit the data.

## Files
- **`download_dataset.py`**: Python script for data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
- **`job_placement.csv`**: Dataset used for the model.
- **`visualization/gpa_vs_salary_plot.png`**: Plot showing the model's predictions.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git
   cd project
